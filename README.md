# California Housing Price Prediction

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply and train Machine Learning Development and Deployment
best practices as well as MLOps principles on a simple application. We use the
California housing dataset to build a prediction model of the median house value.



### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* scikit-learn

## Project Description

## Needs of this project

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

## Featured Notebooks
* [Main Modelling Notebook](notebooks/MLE_D4_LC1_California_Prediction.ipynb)
